# Gallery of Horns

## What Does Our App Do?

This app allows users to vote on their favorite images of horned beasts. By clicking on the images, the number of "likes" will increase and you will see a larger display of the title, image, and description.

You may also use the form at the top of the page to filter the cards based on the number of horns each beast has. For example, selecting 2 horns and clicking the Submit button will only show the beasts with two horns.
